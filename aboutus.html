         <h1>About us</h1> 
         <p>SNS Motors have been buying and selling luxury and performance cars for more than four decades, during which time they have developed an incomparable and respected track record within the motoring industry.

 Education came not in a classroom, but at the car auctions of his native Glasgow. At the age of just 12, in 1973, he sold his first car – a Range Rover – and began the incredible journey which would soon take him across the border into England, where he set up his Derbyshire base in 1980.
Today, the 40-acre Hartley countryside estate where Tom & his son Carl’s family homes and showrooms stand is testament to the unparalleled enterprise, experience, and expertise which has seen the name become synonymous with the supercar market.

Tom Hartley has been widely documented by global media, and recognised by everyone from The Sun and The Financial Times to Top Gear and Bloomberg as the definitive name in prestige cars. Hailed as ‘the Doyen of Supercar Dealers’ by The Daily Telegraph, ‘Britain’s Premier Dealer’ by The Sunday Times and recently recognised by The London Stock Exchange as a ‘company to inspire Britain’, we are unrivalled in our profile and reputation for buying and selling the world’s most sought after vehicles, with customer satisfaction our absolute guarantee.

More than 40 years on from concluding his first deal, Tom Hartley continues to lead the company together with his son Carl who, like his father, was schooled within the business. By 2005, at the age of just 18, Carl completed his apprenticeship having achieved enough success to be able to buy into his father’s business as a full partner.

Together, Tom and Carl continue to work tirelessly to ensure that the quality, luxury, and heritage that are the hallmarks of Tom Hartley are embodied from the moment you venture within the manned gates of the family’s estate.

Whether arriving by car, by helicopter on the estate’s private helipad, or by plane, with a chauffeur service offered from any UK airport, the Tom Hartley customer experience is designed to underpin the values which the brand stands for. Viewing is strictly by appointment only, and available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year – including Christmas Day – for your ultimate convenience.

Upon arrival at our showrooms, which stand against a backdrop of stunning scenery, you will be greeted personally by a member of the Hartley family, as well as our sales manager of almost the last 20 years Gary Tolson, with your privacy and, ultimately, your satisfaction, our absolute priorities.

Our showrooms are home to the widest array of luxury, performance and classic cars available anywhere in the UK, with our expert team on hand to guide you through our range, and ensure the best choice of car for you.

We believe in no substitutes and no compromises, and in the event that we don’t have the exact car you’re looking for, we leave no stone unturned to find it. We boast an unmatched network of global contacts, while our world class team ensures that the most minute detailing, to all of our cars, meets and exceeds our customers requirement.

We will tailor the delivery of your car to best suit you, with worldwide shipping available, while our ongoing aftercare will ensure a long and lasting relationship.
From Rolls Royce to Bugatti, Ferrari to Lamborghini, Porsche to Aston Martin, and everything in between. Whether it’s the latest supercars or ultra-rare classics. Whatever you’re looking for, we pride ourselves on being the definitive go-to destination for the greatest cars ever made.
