         <h1>About us</h1> 
         <p>SNS Motors have been buying and selling luxury and performance cars for more than four decades, during which time they have developed an incomparable and respected track record within the motoring industry.

 Education came not in a classroom, but at the car auctions of his native Glasgow. At the age of just 12, in 1973, he sold his first car – a Range Rover – and began the incredible journey which would soon take him across the border into England, where he set up his Derbyshire base in 1980.
Today, the 40-acre Hartley countryside estate where Tom & his son Carl’s family homes and showrooms stand is testament to the unparalleled enterprise, experience, and expertise which has seen the name become synonymous with the supercar market.

Tom Hartley has been widely documented by global media, and recognised by everyone from The Sun and The Financial Times to Top Gear and Bloomberg as the definitive name in prestige cars. Hailed as ‘the Doyen of Supercar Dealers’ by The Daily Telegraph, ‘Britain’s Premier Dealer’ by The Sunday Times and recently recognised by The London Stock Exchange as a ‘company to inspire Britain’, we are unrivalled in our profile and reputation for buying and selling the world’s most sought after vehicles, with customer satisfaction our absolute guarantee.

More than 40 years on from concluding his first deal, Tom Hartley continues to lead the company together with his son Carl who, like his father, was schooled within the business. By 2005, at the age of just 18, Carl completed his apprenticeship having achieved enough success to be able to buy into his father’s business as a full partner.</p>
